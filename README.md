# InferA

## About InferA - Large-Scale Data Analysis
Inference through AI (InferA) is a data analysis multi-agent system. This project addresses the challenges of analyzing large-scale structured and numerical data using AI technologies. While LLM chatbots excel at language tasks, they struggle with massive datasets. We present a multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations and automate complex data analysis workflows.

## Dataset

Our focus is on the HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code) dataset, a terabyte-scale cosmological simulation suite. This dataset includes:
- Multiple terabytes of data
- Hundreds of timesteps
- Billions of cosmic objects
- Specialized file formats requiring expert interpretation

## Our Solution: Multi-Agent System

We've developed a multi-agent approach to break down complex data analysis tasks:
1. Planner Agent: Translates natural language queries into detailed execution plans
2. Supervisor Agent: Manages dynamic execution and task adjustments
3. Data Loading and SQL Agents: Handle staged data loading
4. Python Agent: Performs logic-intensive analysis and computation
5. Visualization Agent: Generates task-specific plots (e.g., Paraview visualizations)

## Key Features
- Human-in-the-Loop: Allows continuous human feedback and supervision
- State Persistence: Saves all generated outputs and states for easy "time travel"
- Metadata-Aware Reasoning: Uses RAG for context-aware column selection
- Sandboxed Code Execution: Ensures data integrity with read-only access to the main dataset
- Optimized Token Usage: Efficient agent communication (Average run: <40,000 tokens, ~$0.09 with GPT-4)
